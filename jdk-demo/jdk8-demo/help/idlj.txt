Compiler Usage:

    java com.sun.tools.corba.se.idl.toJavaPortable.Compile [options] <idl file>

where <idl file> is the name of a file containing IDL definitions, and
[options] is any combination of the options listed below.  The options
are optional and may appear in any order; <idl file> is required and
must appear last.
 
Options:
-d <symbol>               This is equivalent to the following line in an
                          IDL file:  #define <symbol>
-emitAll                  Emit all types, including those found in #included files.
-f<side>                  Define what bindings to emit.  <side> is one of client,
                          server, all, serverTIE, allTIE.  serverTIE and allTIE
                          cause delegate model skeletons to be emitted.  If this
                          flag is not used, -fclient is assumed.
-i <include path>         By default, the current directory is scanned for
                          included files.  This option adds another directory.
-keep                     If a file to be generated already exists, do not
                          overwrite it.  By default it is overwritten.
-noWarn                   Suppress warnings.
-oldImplBase              Generate skeletons compatible with old (pre-1.4) JDK ORBs.
-pkgPrefix <t> <prefix>   When the type or module name <t> is encountered at
                          file scope, begin the Java package name for all files
                          generated for <t> with <prefix>.
-pkgTranslate <t> <pkg>   When the type or module name <t> in encountered, replace
                          it with <pkg> in the generated java package.  Note that
                          pkgPrefix changes are made first.  <t> must match the
                          full package name exactly.  Also, <t> must not be
                          org, org.omg, or any subpackage of org.omg.
-skeletonName <xxx%yyy>   Name the skeleton according to the pattern.
                          The defaults are:
                          %POA for the POA base class (-fserver or -fall) 
                          _%ImplBase for the oldImplBase base class
                          (-oldImplBase and (-fserver or -fall)).
-td <dir>                 use <dir> for the output directory instead of
                          the current directory.
-tieName <xxx%yyy>        Name the tie according to the pattern.  The defaults are:
                          %POATie for the POA tie (-fserverTie or -fallTie) 
                          %_Tie for the oldImplBase tie
                          (-oldImplBase and (-fserverTie or -fallTie)).
-v, -verbose              Verbose mode.
-version                  Display the version number and quit.
